# Damon - A terminal Dashboard for HashiCorp Nomad

Damon is a terminal user interface (TUI) for Nomad. It provides functionality to observe and interact with Nomad resources such as Jobs, Deployments, or Allocations.

**Additional Notes**

Damon is in an early stage and is under active development. We are working on improving the performance and adding new features to Damon.
Please take a look at the Damon [project board](https://github.com/hashicorp/damon/projects/2) to see what features you can expect in near future.
If you find a bug or you have great ideas how Damon can be improved feel free to open an issue. To avoid duplicates, please check the [project board](https://github.com/hashicorp/damon/projects/2) 
before submitting one. Thank you!
